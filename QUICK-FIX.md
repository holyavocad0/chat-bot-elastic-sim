# Quick Fix for CMS Styling

## The Issue Was Found!

The `resources-dir` configuration needed to be just `_resources` not `public/_resources`.

## Run These Commands Now

```bash
# Pull the fix
git pull

# Clean up broken resources
ddev exec rm -rf public/_resources public/resources _resources

# Clear caches
ddev exec rm -rf silverstripe-cache/

# Run vendor-expose (this should work now!)
ddev composer vendor-expose

# Rebuild
ddev sake dev/build flush=1
```

## What Should Happen

After running `vendor-expose`, you should see:
```
public/_resources/silverstripe/admin/...
```

## Verify It Worked

Check the directory was created:
```bash
ddev exec ls -la public/_resources/
```

You should see directories like:
- `silverstripe/`
  - `admin/`
  - `asset-admin/`
  - `cms/`

## Test the CMS

1. Visit: http://chat-bot-elastic-sim.ddev.site/_resources/silverstripe/admin/client/dist/styles/bundle.css
   - Should show CSS code (not 404)

2. Visit: http://chat-bot-elastic-sim.ddev.site/admin
   - Hard refresh (Ctrl+Shift+R or Cmd+Shift+R)
   - CMS should be fully styled! ✨

## Configuration That Fixed It

In `composer.json`:
```json
{
  "extra": {
    "public-dir": "public",
    "resources-dir": "_resources"
  }
}
```

This tells the vendor-plugin:
- Public directory is at `public/`
- Resources should go in `_resources/`
- Combined result: `public/_resources/` ✅
